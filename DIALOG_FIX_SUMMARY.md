# ðŸŽ‰ PRESCRIPTION DIALOG FIX APPLIED

## Issues Fixed:
1. âœ… **Dialog Auto-Closing**: Dialog was closing unexpectedly when entering next visit date
2. âœ… **Form Submission**: Prevented unwanted form submissions from input fields
3. âœ… **Event Propagation**: Added proper event handling to prevent dialog closure

## Changes Made:

### 1. Form Wrapper & Event Prevention
- Added `<form>` wrapper with `onSubmit={preventFormSubmit}`
- Added `handleDialogClose` function to prevent closing during loading
- Added `type="button"` to all buttons to prevent form submission

### 2. Input Field Protection
- **Next Visit Date**: Added `onKeyDown` and `stopPropagation` handlers
- **Textarea Fields**: Added event protection for symptoms, diagnosis, instructions
- **Medicine Fields**: Protected dosage, duration, quantity inputs
- **Buttons**: Added click event protection for Add/Remove medicine buttons

### 3. Key Event Handling
- Enter key prevention on input fields
- Ctrl+Enter handling for textareas
- Event bubbling prevention

## How It Works Now:
1. ðŸŽ¯ **Next Visit Date**: You can click and select date without dialog closing
2. ðŸŽ¯ **Text Fields**: Type freely without unexpected closures
3. ðŸŽ¯ **Medicine Selection**: Add/remove medicines without issues
4. ðŸŽ¯ **Form Submission**: Only happens when clicking "Add Prescription" button
5. ðŸŽ¯ **Loading State**: Dialog cannot be closed while creating prescription
