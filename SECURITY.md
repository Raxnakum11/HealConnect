# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

HealConnect takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Data Protection
- **Password Hashing**: All user passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with configurable expiration
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration data stored in environment variables
- **Input Validation**: All API inputs are validated using express-validator
- **CORS Protection**: Cross-origin requests are restricted to configured origins
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are protected against abuse with rate limiting

### Database Security
- **Connection Security**: MongoDB connections use secure connection strings
- **Data Validation**: Mongoose schemas enforce data integrity
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for different user types
- **Index Optimization**: Database queries are optimized with proper indexing

### API Security
- **Authentication Required**: Protected endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Different permissions for doctors and patients
- **Request Validation**: All API requests are validated before processing
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't expose sensitive information

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should not be disclosed publicly until they have been addressed.

### 2. Report via Email
Send an email to: [security-email@example.com](mailto:security-email@example.com)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

### 3. Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Initial assessment within 7 days
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: Public disclosure after the fix is deployed

## üîê Security Best Practices for Developers

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Always use strong, unique secrets
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Use secure database connections
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/db?ssl=true

# Configure proper CORS origins
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

### Code Security Guidelines
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Use environment variables
const secret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;

// ‚ùå Bad: Hardcoded secrets
const secret = 'hardcoded-secret';

// ‚úÖ Good: Validate input
const { error } = schema.validate(req.body);

// ‚ùå Bad: Trust user input
const data = req.body;
```

### Deployment Security
- Use HTTPS in production
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use strong database credentials
- Enable MongoDB authentication
- Configure firewall rules
- Regular security audits

## üìã Security Checklist
